# Nostalgia-Shader-dev0.5.1-src
This is the source code for an early build of RRe36's Nostalgia Shader, uploaded for archival purposes. I did not have any involvement on this project in any way, shape
or form, I'm just making it open-source. I didn't upload this shader with malicious intent, I uploaded it because I want to preserve this specific version of the
Nostalgia Shader while allowing others to modify it to their preferences. All the credit goes to the hard work of RRe36.

If you want any more information of the Nostalgia Shader, then feel free to check it out on RRe36's website: https://rre36.com/nostalgia-shader
